= Mikrotik Provider

The mikrotik provider is used to interact with the resources supported by RouterOS.
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

== Requirements

** Terraform 0.12+
** Go 1.11+ (to build the provider plugin)
** RouterOS v6.45.2+ (It may work with other versions but it is untested against other versions!)

== Using the provider

If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to install it as a https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-plugins[plugin]. After placing it into your plugins directory, run `terraform init` to initialize it.

== Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the mikrotik Provider
provider "mikrotik" {
  host = "hostname-of-server:8728"     # Or set MIKROTIK_HOST environment variable
  username = "<username>"              # Or set MIKROTIK_USER environment variable
  password = "<password>"              # Or set MIKROTIK_PASSWORD environment variable
}
```
